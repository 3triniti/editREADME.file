Books in Paradise project

For this project I will reconfigure existing information and data, while adding depth to the webpage.  This will include an improvement to the overall look and feel of the webpage.

I will work with the Owner of "Talk Story Bookstore", implementing his ideas into the revamped web-page, making sure to include what are the most important elements for him.

 After establishing contact with client through a one on one meeting, and gaining his approval for the project, I will begin drawing up rough drafts of the layout.
I am choosing "Talk Story Bookstore" for my project because of the personal contact that I have had with the establishment, as well as some of the personal frustrations that I have expressed about their limitations in marketing themselves to the public.
The only issues that I see in this project would be time.  I do not foresee a lack of cooperation or information being a problem.  I have good rapport with the Owner, which is always a good start.
This project should take a total of eight weeks to complete, most of which will be spend organizing information in the most visually effective way.
I will need to spend at least twelve hours a week on this project.  With a projected time of 96 total hours for the project.  
This amount of time should give me what I need to complete an effective project, while offering workable solution for the client.
I plan to add aesthetics to give more warmth and welcome, while adding a sidebar that allows a more in-depth experience for the guests. This dropdown effect will allow guest to explore the many genres of books that are available in the store.
The pre-existing navbar will continue to be the focal point, but the side bar allows for more exploration.
